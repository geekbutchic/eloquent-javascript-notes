# Eloquent Javascript Notes
* ARITHMETIC 

  * `PEMDAS` Parenthesis Equals Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction 
  * `100 + 4 * 11`
  * In this situation multiplication would happen first.
  * `(100 + 4) * 11`
  * In this situation parenthesis would happen first.
* STRINGS 
  * Strings are created using 'quotations'
  * `\n` interpreted as a new line 
  * "This is the first line\nAnd this is the second line."
```javascript
This is the first line 
And this is the second
```
* CONCATENATION 
  * "con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"
  * The line above will produce the string "concatenate"
  * `half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
  * When you write somthing inside ${} in a template literal, it's results will be computed, converted to a sting, and included at that position.
  * `"half of 100 is 50"`

* UNARY OPERATORS
  * `console.log (typeof 4.5) -> number`
  * `console.log (typeof "x") -> string`
  * Operators that use two values are called binary operators, while those that take one care called unary operators.

* BOOLEAN VALUES 
  * Only two possible values "yes" or "no" 

COMPARISON 

* `>= (greater than or equal to)`
* `<= (less than or equal to)`
* `=== (equal to)`
* `!= (not equal to)`

LOGICAL OPERATORS
